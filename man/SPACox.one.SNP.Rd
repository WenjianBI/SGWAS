\title{SaddlePoint Approximation implementation of Cox regression surival analysis (One-SNP-version)}
\usage{
SPACox.one.SNP(
  g,
  obj.null,
  Cutoff = 2,
  impute.method = "fixed",
  missing.cutoff = 0.15,
  min.maf = 1e-04,
  CovAdj.cutoff = 5e-05,
  G.model = "Add"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{a numeric genotype vector. Missing genotype should be coded as NA. Both hard-called and imputed genotype data are supported.}

\item{others}{the same as function SPACox. NOTE that we do not check subject order in this one-snp-version !!!}
}
\value{
the same as function SPACox.
}
\description{
One-SNP-version SPACox function. This function is to facilitate users that prefer reading and analyzing genotype line-by-line.
